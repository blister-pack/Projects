This project is meant to serve as an experiment.
I wanted to make a simple application of linked lists.

The idea isn't to make a practical application of linked lists.
I just want to try and make use of them while learning some stuff, hopefully.

All things considered, this is the type of project that gives meaning to the saying "before considering if you could, consider if you should".
