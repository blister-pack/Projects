My first attempt at making an app with a GUI
I kept it simple enough for me to understand the inner workings of making a UI, the logic for it and being able to connect it all in an app file.
A simple, fun learning experience

Actually it wasn't simple at all, I struggled for hours to find good information on how I should do this following the MVC pattern and I couldn't really understand the information I did get.

Thank you Ovidiu for your patience and dedication to teaching me, the app is now working and I'm sure this is the stepping stone to making many more.
